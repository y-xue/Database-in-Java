For IntHistogram, we just followed the bucket-based method provided in the lab assignment sheet.
For tablestats, we created several maps (eg. min, max, hist) to keep track the status. We used iterator to go through the given file to fulfill the min/max tracker, then rewind the iterator to go over and create the histograms.
For estimateSelectivity, we used the previous implemented function histogram.estimateSelectivity to implement.
For estimateJoinCost and estimateJoinCardinality, we simply followed the instruction and did some math work. For join ordering, since the pseudocode gave a clear path and we had handy helper methods like enumerateSubsets, it didnâ€™t make a big difficulty.

We took around 9-10 hours on this project.
